## Behaviour & Contribution Notes (Leadership & Commitment)

### 🔹 Leadership Rotation & Change

The team originally agreed that leadership would rotate every 3 weeks.  
I served as the first group leader. However, as the project progressed, it became clear that there was **insufficient commitment and collaboration** from some members.  

As a result, in the presence of the module leader, we agreed that I would step back into a **regular member role**, and another team member would take over as **leader**. From that point, my role became:
- Supporting the new leader,
- Staying fully prepared for all tasks,
- Continuing to push for progress and meetings.

---

### 🔹 Period of Low Progress (After Leadership Change)

After the leadership change, there was a period of around **two weeks without classes and without any meaningful project progress**, despite:
- Repeated reminders to the new leader to **schedule meetings** and help the team move according to the plan.
- Repeated encouragement to another member to **solve ongoing GitHub issues** so that they could contribute through the repository.

During this period:
- Planned work did **not move through the Kanban stages** (Ready → In Progress → In Review).
- There was **no concrete follow-through** on suggested meeting times.
- Collaboration remained limited, despite multiple nudges.

Eventually, the new leader began to feel the pressure of the upcoming deadlines and **engaged more actively** in planning and completing tasks.

---

### 🔹 Active Collaboration vs. Non-Commitment

In practical terms, most of the final project work was completed through **active collaboration between two members**, who:
- Stayed available and prepared for tasks,
- Took responsibility for uncompleted items,
- Ensured that the report and requirements were finished, even under time pressure.

At the same time, one team member showed **consistently low commitment** to the course project, including:
- Limited engagement with GitHub and task ownership,
- Resistance to scheduling or attending working sessions,
- Minimal contribution to moving tasks across the Kanban board.

Rather than escalating conflicts, the active members focused on **finishing the project on time**, even if this meant completing work that had originally been assigned to others.

---

### 🔹 Summary

This section documents:
- The **reason for the leadership change**,
- The **lack of progress during the transition period**,
- The **eventual increased engagement from the new leader**, and
- The **imbalance of contributions**, where two members carried the bulk of the work.

These notes are intended as a factual record of team dynamics and commitment levels, in line with the module’s expectations around group work and evidence of participation.
