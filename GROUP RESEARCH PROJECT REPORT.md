## **Public Attitudes Toward AI in Customer Service**
*This project examines public attitudes toward AI in customer service, using survey data to evaluate key factors such as trust, convenience, helpfulness, and ease of interaction. Statistical analyses reveal generally positive perceptions, with trust and convenience emerging as the strongest predictors of AI preference and usage intention. The findings provide clear insights into how users form opinions about AI systems and what influences their willingness to adopt them.*

### Descriptive Analysis

The descriptive statistics provide an initial understanding of respondents’ overall attitudes toward AI customer service. Composite means indicate moderately positive but generally cautious evaluations on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Convenience (M = 3.05, SD = 0.86), Preference for AI (M = 3.00, SD = 1.01), and Behavioral Intention (M = 2.96, SD = 1.02) were the highest-rated constructs, suggesting that respondents slightly agreed that AI offers functional advantages and that they might use such systems again. In contrast, Ease of Interaction (M = 2.85, SD = 0.80), Helpfulness (M = 2.74, SD = 0.90), and Trust (M = 2.71, SD = 0.88) remained close to the midpoint. These lower scores imply reservations regarding AI’s understanding, reliability, and interpretive capability.

### Correlations among key constructs

The output of the correlation analysis was that all key variables had very strong, positive relationships between them. The variables Helpfulness, Convenience, Ease of Interaction, and Trust had very high inter-correlations with values between approximately r ≈ 0.65 and r = 0.84. Not only this, but also the Preference for AI and Behavioral Intention showed very high correlation with the other constructs, r ≈ 0.69–0.87, which means that good experiential evaluations are very much associated with stronger preferences and a higher likelihood of use of AI interfaces again. Trust was recognized as a particularly important concept, as it had strong correlations not only with Preference for AI (r ≈ 0.72) but also with Behavioral Intention (r ≈ 0.80). The findings that both Trust and perceived Convenience are very important factors in the process of AI acceptance at the correlational level, thus providing support for H1 and H2 in this respect. The situation is similar to what is found in the established technology acceptance research, especially TAM and related models, where trust and perceived usefulness are always the primary factors influencing user attitudes and behavioral responses.

### Group differences by tech comfort (H3)

One-way ANOVA was the statistical method of choice to figure out the level of the radically different attitudes that might at the top be associated with the self-reported respondents' levels of technology comfort. The major findings did not indicate statistically different outcomes for Trust, F(3,56) ≈ 0.58, p ≈ 0.63, nor for Preference for AI, F(3,56) ≈ 1.59, p > 0.05. However, the group of "very comfortable" described themselves slightly more positively, but the differences were small enough not to be counted as statistically significant. Thus, the hypothesis was rejected. In light of this, it is seen that the finding holds that technology is not a barrier in the case of negative attitudes towards AI customer service, while the opposite holds for positive attitudes. In addition, the central point of this finding is the already-stated nature of the case that acceptance of AI systems relies much more on the prior experience with specific AI tools, perceived fairness, and perceived quality of interaction rather than on the general technology skill level.

### Group differences by AI usage frequency (H4)

Differences in attitudes were also examined based on respondents’ frequency of AI customer service use. The ANOVA results showed significant effects for Trust, F(2,57) ≈ 6.44, p ≈ 0.003, and Ease of Interaction, F(2,57) ≈ 3.52, p ≈ 0.04. Respondents who used AI customer service tools more frequently reported higher trust levels and smoother interaction experiences. The effect for Convenience approached significance, F(2,57) ≈ 2.90, p ≈ 0.06, but did not meet the 5% threshold. These results provide partial support for H4, indicating that familiarity and repeated exposure improve user confidence and interaction quality, although perceived convenience may be recognized regardless of usage frequency. This trend is consistent with previous research demonstrating that repeated exposure reduces uncertainty and builds trust over time.

### Regression models (H1, H2, H5)

Regression analyses were carried out to investigate the predictive relationships between Trust, Helpfulness, Convenience, Preference for AI, and Behavioral Intention. In the bivariate models, Trust alone was responsible for the largest portion of the variance in Behavioral Intention (R² ≈ 0.63). On the other hand, Convenience was given a smaller but still considerable share of variance (R² ≈ 0.48). The three single predictor’s model of Trust, Helpfulness, and Convenience performed very well with R² ≈ 0.71 and all predictors being significant (p < 0.05). Trust was by far the strongest predictor, making its fundamental importance for future interaction with AI systems clearly visible. The same predictive model for Preference for AI made it possible to obtain the R² value of about 0.65, with Trust being the most important factor again. These findings confirm hypotheses H1, H2, and H5, demonstrating that Trust and the perception of Convenience significantly influence the preference for AI, while the joint model offers an excellent explanation of the behavioral intentions.
